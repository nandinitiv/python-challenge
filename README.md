GW Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge 

In the first part of this challenge, I analyzed financial records to calculate the net total of profits and losses over the period, the changes in profits and losses, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits over the period.

In the second part of this challenge, I analyzed poll data to determine the total number of votes cast, the list of candidates, the percentage of votes won by each candidate, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

I used help from my instructor, study groups, and online resources to write the code. I used chat GPT for some code and troubleshooting.
